XBDD is a tool to unite automated and manual testing efforts using Cucumber feature files. Test reports can be uploaded to XBDD manually or via a continuous integration server, giving you an information radiator on how many tests are passing, how many failed and how many can be run manually. Pin a report and get your team to walk through the manual feature files and check off each step to perform a full regression test.

See the [user guide](/docs/usage/user-guide.md) for a fuller overview of XBDD functionality.
